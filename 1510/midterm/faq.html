		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions/h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Do I need a bin to make compost?
</strong></th>
				<td>No, organic matter will eventually decompose without human help. But a container of some sort will keep your pile neat, protect it from the weather and pests, and make the job of tending it much easier.</td> </tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Can I compost in the winter?
</strong></th>
				<td>You can retain heat a little longer in the fall by covering the pile and insulating the container, perhaps with bags of leaves. Increasing the amount of "green" or using a compost activator may help keep the temperature up. </td> </tr>
			<tr>
				<th>Should I add ground limestone, soil, or fertilizer?
</strong></th>
				<td>A perfectly good compost pile can be built out of nothing fancier than leaves and grass clippings. Lime will balance out the pH of a pile of highly acidic materials, like pine needles. </td> </tr>
		<th>When is compost "finished" and safe to use?
</strong></th>
				<td>When an active compost pile fails to heat up once more, and very little of the original material can be recognized (perhaps an eggshell or the shapes of old leaves), the compost is ready to use. </td> </tr>
<th> What if I make too much compost?
</strong></th>
<td>he earth can use all the organic matter you can give it, and you can apply compost at any time of year. Dig it into flower beds, layer it over a vegetable garden, or spread it under a tree to feed the roots. </td></tr>
