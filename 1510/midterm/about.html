		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello there! Welcome to my page. If you've stumbled on this page, it means you are probably interested in composting! Composting is a great way to reduce your carbon footprint,
    and help the environment. <br>
      I first found a passion for the environment in college. I attended the University of Georgia from 2015-2020, and I was an Ecology major. I quickly found this to be something I 
      am incredibly interested in, and found my niche with composting and reducing waste. I figured, instead of filling landfills with more waste, why not reuse it for better purposes? <br>
      So, here we are. I am still learning, as are you! Together, we can learn all about composting and make this planet a better place! <p>
